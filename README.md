# Door Lock System

## Overview
A secure and reliable door lock system implemented to control access via PIN code entry. This project leverages [mention any microcontroller or platform, e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ATmega32] to handle user inputs and control locking mechanisms efficiently. 

## Features
- **PIN Authentication**: Users enter a PIN to lock or unlock the door.
- **User Management**: Add, remove, or change user PINs.
- **Security Alert**: Triggers an alarm after multiple incorrect attempts.
- **Display Feedback**: Shows messages or status on an LCD or LED display.
- **Power Failure Handling**: Securely retains lock state even during power loss.

## Components
- Microcontroller (e.g., ATmega32)
- Keypad (4x4 matrix keypad recommended)
- LCD Display (16x2 or 20x4)
- Servo or Solenoid Lock
- Buzzer (for alert signaling)
- Power Supply (e.g., 5V DC)
- Resistors, Wires, and Breadboard (for prototyping)

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the keypad to the microcontroller for user input.
   - Connect the LCD display to show status messages.
   - Attach the lock mechanism (servo/solenoid) to the microcontroller for control.
   - (Optional) Connect the buzzer to signal incorrect PIN attempts.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/door-lock-system.git
     ```
   - Install required libraries (if any) for [microcontroller platform].

3. **Compile and Upload**:
   - Use your preferred IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE for Arduino) to compile and upload the code to the microcontroller.

## Usage
1. **Enter PIN**: Use the keypad to enter your assigned PIN code.
2. **Lock/Unlock**: The system will lock or unlock based on correct PIN entry.
3. **Manage Users**: Access the settings to add, delete, or change PINs (details in the code comments).
4. **Security Alert**: After 3 incorrect attempts, the system will activate the buzzer to alert.
